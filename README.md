# Give_Life_-Predict_Blood_Donations

Blood Donation Prediction

Project Description:-

•Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. According to WebMD, "about 5 million Americans need a blood transfusion every year".

•Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.

•The data is stored in datasets/transfusion.data and it is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM). We'll explore what that means later in this   notebook. First, let's inspect the data.

Project Tasks:-

 1. Inspecting transfusion.data file

 2. Loading the blood donations data

 3. Inspecting transfusion DataFrame

 4. Creating target column

 5. Checking target incidence

 6. Splitting transfusion into train and test datasets

 7. Selecting model using TPOT

 8. Checking the variance

 9. Log normalization

 10. Training the linear regression model

 11. Conclusion
